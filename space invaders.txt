classes for:
the player character, a fast alien hunter
	values: location?, lives
	moves based on player input
	upon occupying the same space as a bullet or enemy, the gamestate goes down 1 life.

the walls, static barriers that can break
	values: stage
	when it occupies the same state as a bullet, it goes down a stage and gets slightly smaller. once it hits stage 21 or so, it is deleted.

the enemies, slow-moving yet encroaching aliens
	values: location, stage
	moves left until it hits the left edge, where it moves down 1 and starts going right until it hits the right edge and goes down 1. repeat. also it shoots a bullet downwards every few seconds.
	if it occupies the same space as a bullet, it disappears and gives you 10 pts.
